                    <p>Hailing from The Golden State - San Francisco, CA - comes Swu, one of the industry's most versatile recording artists and producers. Growing up and living all around the world, Swu embodies the creative and open-mindedness of different cultures. In his first EP Human, he hopes bring to life emotions from the best parts of our lives to remind us that we are all human. He stated that "each song captures an emotion and a story from a part of my life. It doesn't matter what language you speak, what culture you're from, or what race you are - everyone can relate and share these stories"</p> 
                    <p>Swu's music career started in the 4th grade, when he found his fatherâ€™s old guitar in the attic. He played on the guitar for hours that day and instantly fell in love with music. Since then, Swu has picked up a myriad of different instruments, from baritone, to drums, to piano, and to vocals, and won several battle of the bands, songwriting competitions, and talent shows. These were the first stepping stones to a lifetime passion in music.</p>
                    <p>From his musical background and studying computer science at Carnegie Mellon, Swu is able to synthesize unique sounds and write chord progressions. He uses Nyquist to synthesize sounds from scratch, Carnegie Mellon's studio to record vocals, and Logic Pro to put it all together. Throughout his musical career, he has been able to perform weekly sets at Iron Horse, a local bar and grill, perform at spring fairs, carnivals, and concert halls, and found an annual charity concert with the Boy Scouts of America. Now, he is focused on creating and producing his own music with the Carnegie Mellon School of Music, IMO, and independent artists.</p>
