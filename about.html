    <meta name="description" content="SWU is an EDM songwriter, DJ, and producer who is attempting to redefine the genre. He combines EDM with elements of hip-hop, pop, and jazz to push the boundaries of genre and wants to be the first to make genreless music. He started out making hip-hop beats for Def Jam Recordings, working with artists such as DJ Mustard, Machine Gun Kelly, and Anders Oland. Now at Atlantic Records, he is launching into his own music career with his first single since Def Jam, “Maybe”, that charted top 10 on SoundCloud. He expects to release more music with Future Bass and Atlantic soon.

Hailing from The Golden State, SWU is a songwriter, DJ, and producer in EDM and hip-hop. He has lived in several cities around the world and embodies the creative and open-mindedness of international cultures. SWU’s music career started at age 9, when he plucked some strings on a guitar and realized it was really fun. He named his first song “Juice Box” because he was literally drinking a juice box, and didn’t even realized he was starting a life-long passion in music.
<br><br>

His first break came when he won a music competition at Carnegie Mellon, where he had the chance to show his songs to Def Jam A&R reps. From there, he got a job producing songs and remixes for many of their artists such as DJ Mustard and Machine Gun Kelly. His music is regularly played on several radio stations, such as Nerve DJs, since1974radio, K-100 Radio, Auma Radio, WWMR 105, and WTSX 104.9.
<br><br>
EDM is at the base of his music, with big synths running the show and elements sprinkled in from hip- hop, pop, and jazz. His goal is to redefine EDM. As modern music evolves, genre is becoming less relevant – especially in EDM. He sees the world of music heading towards a tipping point soon, where EDM becomes just music and wants to be the first to create genreless music.
<br><br>
Now at Atlantic Records, he is in talks with some big names in EDM, such as Diplo and David Guetta. He released his first single "Maybe" that charted top 10 on Soundcloud and is featured on YourEDM and EDMTunes. He is working on some music that is game-changing in EDM and looks forward to working with Atlantic and Future Bass Records.</p>
